# Volume-Hand-Control
Gesture Analysis and Control using Computer Vision and Mediapipe with System access features on a MAC os 
The Following code files comprise the use of librabry such as mediapipe, OpenCV, subprocess to commit to the task of Hand Gesture Volume Control.
Camera Feed is taken with conidering index finger tip and Thumb tip with interpolated ends and volume with 0-100 in percentage with the distance betweeen the taken tips of fingers 
We use findHands method in mediapipe for that purpose.
OpenCV is used to access camera and images for study and processing if required 
Subprocess module is used to used to gain acces of system volume ans run apple scripts to control it.
